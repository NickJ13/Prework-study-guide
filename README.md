## Full stack developer bootcamp

My motivation to take this class was mainly a career change, and wanted to challenge myself to something new. I built my first PC a couple years ago and thought they were pretty cool to work on and with.
In this prework project, i built a website containing notes on what I learned in in the prework, which was entry to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub flow.
The problems it solved where the first steps into getting my foot in the door with coding.
What I learned was how websites are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
